# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Overview
--------
This folder centralizes OctoAcme's project management process documentation so teams can quickly discover, understand, and apply consistent workflows. These docs capture our lifecycle from lightweight initiation through planning, execution, release, and continuous improvement, and they surface the key artifacts, responsibilities, and checklists teams need to deliver predictable outcomes.

Project management summary
--------------------------
OctoAcme uses a pragmatic, iterative approach focused on customer value and measurable outcomes. Work begins with a Project One-pager to capture the problem, goal, success metrics, stakeholders, and a rough timeline. Approved initiatives move into planning where work is decomposed into a prioritized backlog, dependencies are identified, a Definition of Done is defined, and release milestones are mapped.

Execution is tracked on a project board with timeboxed planning and a disciplined PR workflow to keep work small, reviewable, and traceable. Teams follow a clear cadence of standups, delivery syncs, demos, and retrospectives. Quality practices combine automated CI checks (unit, integration, smoke tests, and security scans) with manual QA and acceptance criteria verification. Releases follow a checklist-driven process that includes staging verification, rollback planning, and incident playbooks.

Roles, communication, and continuous improvement
------------------------------------------------
Roles are explicitly defined: Product Managers set outcomes and measure success, Project Managers coordinate delivery and communications, Developers implement and test, QA validates acceptance, and stakeholders provide input and approvals. Communication uses a single source of truth (project README / release docs), regular cadence (weekly PM syncs, twice-weekly standups or as agreed, monthly stakeholder updates), and templates for status and incident communication. Retrospectives capture learnings and convert them into tracked action items to drive continuous improvement.
